# Mission and Values

Have Fund is truly unique. There are countless conventional investment funds,
but only one of them is decentralized. As an extraordinary product,
the Fund carries an extraordinary purpose and offers extraordinary value to the World.
In this article, we’ll explore the core principles, the synergy of which defines its mission.

## Accessibility

Have Fund removes every barrier to entry.

There is no requirement to verify:

* Your identity;
* The source of your funds;
* Anything else.

The Fund interacts with anonymous addresses on a decentralized network.
I do not collect or disclose any data about the address holders,
even if I happen to learn them on personal grounds.

[The Fund’s smart contract](/code/have-fund) is free of any lockup mechanisms, token burns,
or forced ownership restrictions. No authority on Earth can forbid anyone to use the Fund.

There is no minimum investment threshold.
The smart contract accepts any amount, even if it’s just one cent.

This unconditional openness makes the Fund an accessible diversification tool
for a wide spectrum of investors, from novices to seasoned professionals.

## Transparency

Have Fund is built on the principle of absolute openness.

The code for the Fund’s smart contracts and its token is publicly available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/nelkor/have-fund/tree/main/src) and operates on Avalanche
[public blockchain](https://snowtrace.io/address/0xe83EBE2b62f2FA384Ee842EE7147A8Cb9CBB2F53).

Anyone in the World can examine the Fund’s logic,
make certain of the absence of hidden functions, and evaluate the security of the system.

All Fund transactions are recorded on the blockchain forever.
You can monitor its transaction history and current capital in real time
via [DeBank](https://debank.com/profile/0xaaAaeC452BD175Be98E71745AB2686dFb5777777)
or other convenient services.

In the Telegram channel [Создаю фонд](https://t.me/creating_fund),
I regularly share screenshots of the Fund’s DeBank balance.
Every time I re-balance positions, I publish detailed review videos.

## Censorship Immunity

Have Fund is deployed on [the Avalanche network](https://avax.network).
Its logic is implemented through immutable smart contracts.
Once published, their code cannot be altered, removed, or paused.

That means that neither regulators nor law enforcement agencies,
nor anyone else can intervene, freeze, or restrict the Fund’s operations.

The fully decentralized infrastructure guarantees that governance and access remain
genuinely free and autonomous—shielded from external interference or single points of failure.

## Single-Handed Management

You entrust your capital to [me](https://t.me/nelkor),
and I assure you I will not delegate that responsibility to anyone else.

Unlike DAO models where contributors vote and decisions are often made
by inexperienced participants, here every decision is mine.
They are based on thorough market analysis and a well-calibrated strategy.

I welcome ideas and advice. I am ready to take them into account while making decisions.
I will listen to everyone, conduct my own analysis, and act in the Fund’s best interest.
Every step I make is supported by in-depth commentary in my regular position-review videos.

## Low Risk

Have Fund constructs positions with capital preservation as its guiding priority.

I consciously give up the idea of using aggressive, high-yield instruments.
It’s better to earn moderate but stable returns than to gamble.

Capital is reallocated adaptively, in response to current market conditions.
I strive to maintain balance between safety and profitability.

Some part of the Fund’s profits is held in [reserve](/management/reserve).
In case of a severe, prolonged market downturn, this reserve can be distributed
among investors. This smoothing mechanism narrows the gap between exceptionally
profitable and less fortunate periods, making returns more predictable
and shielding investors from volatility.

## Technology Popularization

By cooperating with the Fund, investors become acquainted with wallets,
decentralized networks, and tokens. This alone provides modern users
with fundamental hands-on experience in cryptocurrency technologies.

Moreover, in my position-review videos, I highlight DeFi instruments
and immerse viewers in the mechanics of how they function. There are even standalone,
non-related to the Fund videos, where I demonstrate in detail how to use these tools.

A diligent follower of the channel can acquire skills and deepen their understanding
of decentralized finance principles even without becoming a Fund investor.

Have Fund strictly follows its principles and gains success due to this.
