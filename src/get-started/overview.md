# What the Fund Is

**Have Fund** (or simply “the Fund”) is a modern investment tool
designed for anyone who wants to grow their savings without the hassle
of studying financial markets in depth. The Fund pools together participants’
money, giving everyone a chance to easily outpace inflation while keeping
direct control over their investments—no middlemen required.

## Investment Funds

People use money and wonder how to protect and increase it.
Not everyone wants to become an investment expert—and that’s perfectly fine.
That’s why investment funds exist.

* **Capital aggregation.**
  Every participant contributes part of their capital. Pooled together,
  these funds reach a scale much larger than individual investments,
  unlocking access to better instruments and strategies.
* **Professional management.**
  A team of specialists manages the pooled funds. They watch the markets,
  diversify the portfolio, and look for growth opportunities.
* **Investor simplicity.**
  You don’t need to track dozens of companies or analyze price charts yourself.
  You entrust that work to experts and simply enjoy the returns.

## How Have Fund Is Different

Have Fund brings the idea of an investment fund into
a [decentralized](/core-concepts/decentralized-networks) environment—no banks,
no regulators.

* **Direct ownership of assets.**
  In traditional funds, shares are held by custodians or banks. In Have Fund,
  you keep HAVE tokens on your
  [personal address](/core-concepts/address-management)—nobody can freeze
  your assets.
* **Decentralization and transparency.**
  The entire Fund operates on an open blockchain. Any participant can check the
  state of the asset pool and review
  the full transaction [history](/management/history) at any time.
* **Working with a digital dollar.**
  To minimize volatility, the Fund uses
  the USDT [stablecoin](/defi/tokens/stablecoins),
  pegged to the U.S. dollar. This lets you hold and invest in
  an international currency, bypassing local restrictions or sanctions.

## The Fund’s Operating Cycle

Have Fund alternates between two states: open and closed periods.
The closed period is the Fund’s normal state, while the open period happens
only briefly and infrequently.

### Open Period

* Anyone can invest any amount of USDT into the Fund and receive HAVE tokens.
* Anyone can sell his HAVE tokens back to the Fund, locking in profits.

This is the time to make decisions. Buying HAVE tokens at a good price is only
possible during the open period. In the closed period, tokens can only
be bought [second-hand](/using/secondary-market)—and usually at a premium.

### Closed Period

* The Fund does not accept new investments,
  issue new HAVE tokens, or offer direct buybacks.
* The invested USDT remains publicly in circulation
  under the watchful eye of participants.
* HAVE tokens can be traded peer-to-peer or on external (decentralized)
  exchanges, where their price reflects supply and demand.

This model is similar to closed-end mutual funds:
you can’t redeem shares at any time, but you can trade them on an exchange.

## Why It’s Beneficial

* **Automation and simplicity.**
  No need to open a brokerage account—just hold USDT.
* **Accessibility for everyone.**
  No citizenship or residency checks—the decentralized network
  doesn’t require passports.
* **Transparent management.**
  All operations are recorded on the blockchain;
  anyone can verify that everything is above board.
* **No counterparty risk.**
  No intermediaries means no risk of delays or asset freezes.
